# An example in Clojure

It wouldn't be nice to [propose a coding _kata_](http://vaguery.github.io/tablecloth/index.html) that I didn't do for myself. So I've been working through this collection (it's really _several_, to be honest). I chose Clojure, for various personal reasons, but that shouldn't affect your solution or reasoning.

1. [getting set up](getting-started.html)
2. [the `skyline` function](skyline-function.html)
3. [`skyline-changed?` predicate](skyline-changed.html)
4. [skyline normalizer](skyline-normalizer.html)
5. [skyline reducer](skyline-reducer.html) (in progress)
6. skyline optimizer (TBD)
7. skyline counter (TBD)
8. skyline histogrammer (TBD)
